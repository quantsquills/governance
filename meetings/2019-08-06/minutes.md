## 1. Previous minutes

Simon moved that we accept the previous meeting's minutes. Rosie seconded, and the motion was passed.

## 2. Business arising from previous meeting

Simon noted that planning was progressing well with the next month's speakers lined up. The meeting discussed moving the September meeting a week to potentially get some international speakers who would be in Brisbane.

Simon noted that the speaker survey had been set up but had not yet been a great success. Rosie suggested we see if it worked any better in August.

Simon said it was unlikely that Quants and Quills would get any new sponsorship arrangements at this point in the year but it would be worth discussing this further at the next management committee meeting.

## 3. Finances

Simon noted that there was $1,578.76 in the bank account. He said he would follow up with Dan to see whether any ThoughtWorks invoices were outstanding.

## 4. New business

Simon discussed an idea he had seen working at a recent BrisJS meetup where a speaker started the meet-up with a five-minute verbal summary of news. Rosie agreed it was worth considering but its success would be dependent on finding the right person to do it.

Simon noted that it would be useful to set the AGM date before the next meet-up so it could be advertised in advance.

## 5. Tasks

Simon said he would follow up with Dan about jobs discussed during the meeting.

Rosie said she would set a date for the AGM and email this to the other committee members.

The meeting was closed at 9:03am.
