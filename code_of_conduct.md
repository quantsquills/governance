* Sexual images in public spaces
* Deliberate intimidation, stalking, or following
* Harassing photography or recording
*	Sustained disruption of talks or other events
*	Inappropriate physical contact
*	Unwelcome sexual attention
*	Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behaviour

## Enforcement
Participants asked to stop any harassing behaviour are expected to comply immediately.
If a participant engages in harassing behaviour, event organisers retain the right to take any actions to keep the event a welcoming environment for all participants. This includes warning the offender or expulsion from the event.
Organisers may take action to redress anything designed to, or with the clear impact of, disrupting the event or making the environment hostile for any participants. We expect participants to follow these rules at all event venues and event-related social activities.

## Reporting
If someone makes you or anyone else feel unsafe or unwelcome, please report it to an organiser as soon as possible. Harassment and other Code of Conduct violations reduce the value of our event for everyone. We want you to be happy at our event. People like you make our event a better place. You can make a report either personally or anonymously.
### Anonymous report
[You can make an anonymous report here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc2YadsX4u6Winj9VFEbnfvLPbk5zXU7TpxQnSenw0relri4w/viewform). We can't follow up an anonymous report with you directly, but we will fully investigate it and take whatever action is necessary to prevent a recurrence.
### Personal report
You can make a personal report by:
* Contacting an organiser directly
*	Emailing us: hello@quantsquills.com

When taking a personal report, the organisers will ensure you are safe and cannot be overheard. They may involve other organisers to ensure your report is managed properly. Once safe, we'll ask you to tell us about what happened. This can be upsetting, but we'll handle it as respectfully as possible, and you can bring someone to support you. You won't be asked to confront anyone and we won't tell anyone who you are.
Our team will be happy to help you contact venue security, local law enforcement, local support services, provide escorts, or otherwise assist you to feel safe for the duration of the event. We value your attendance.
