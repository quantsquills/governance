## 1. Previous minutes

A motion was passed to accept the minutes from the previous meeting.

## 2. New business

The group discussed a survey of members which was shared on Twitter and in the newsletter. It got very few responses. Suggestions made were to mention it at the next meet-up and provide iPads for people to do it in person.

There was discussion of doing food that wasn't pizza and everyone was in favour. Pizza was costing $150-$200 but this could be reduced by self-catering. A roster of who does what during the night helps not leave anyone in the lurch.

Simon explained that any organisation requesting money other than for selling products needed to declare its tax-exempt status.

Simon moved a motion to resolve that Quants and Quills is a tax-exempt organisation. Rosie seconded the motion. There were no objections and the motion was passed.

The group discussed potential topics for the next two months of meet-ups including emergency coverage and coronavirus and agreed to regroup soon.
