## General business

Simon raises the idea of a policy working group to look at refining our constitution and making it more relevant.

Matt Liddy suggested that we could outline our statistics on various association objectives (gender diversity etc.) at a regular meeting.

We should investigate a way to make it easier to sign up members to the Association.

We resolve to register and setup a website to point to our various web resources.
