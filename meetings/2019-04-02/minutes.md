## 1. Previous minutes

Simon made a statement that the previous meeting's minutes were correct.

## 2. Business from previous meeting

Simon said it would still be worthwhile to pursue a pitch for Google funding.

Simon said last year’s annual return had been filed but had not been done by the deadline; this year it must be done within a month of the AGM.

The committee discussed events planning for 2019 and Simon entered details into a spreadsheet.

Simon spoke about launching a website for the group, which would include details of upcoming events, a way for people to subscribe to the newsletter, and a way for members to join.

The committee discussed the positive reception that the newsletter had met with so far.

## 3. Finances

Dan said there was $2,330 in the bank account, but there was some outstanding reimbursements from 2018 yet to be paid. With these taken into account, the balance would sit at about $3,000.

## 4. New business

Simon spoke about wanting to formalise the descriptions of the roles on the management committee. Rosie said it would be beneficial to have more people on the management committee and Simon agreed, saying this would help with succession planning.

Simon suggested setting up a calendar of dates and a list of priorities to be worked through including launching the website, gathering more sponsorship, perfecting the newsletter, event planning, reactivating past attendees, setting up a speaker survey. He suggested this could be achieved with a GitHub ticket; members of the committee could assign their own priorities.

## 5. Future meetings

No date was set for the next meeting.
