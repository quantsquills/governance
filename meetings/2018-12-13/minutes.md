## 1. Previous minutes

Simon made a statement that the previous meeting's minutes were correct.

## 2. Finances

Dan said the organisation was finishing the year in front, having not spent much money, and invited the committee to think of how to spend funds in 2019 - for example by sponsoring speakers.

## 3. New business

Simon reported back from conversations he had with a representative of the Google News Initiative in the Asia Pacific region: there was interest in collaborating on Hacks/Hackers events, and Simon said he felt confident of getting direct sponsorship.

The committee discussed putting in a proposal to ask the Google News Initiative for funding to bring interstate speakers to Brisbane. Simon suggested creating a Google Doc to collaborate and get the pitch together. It was agreed this would be difficult to complete before the end of the year, but could be done early in the new year.

The committee discussed the timeline around filing the annual return and noted it was required to be filed within six months of the annual general meeting.

Ideas for events in 2019 were discussed in brief. Simon suggested any further ideas could be raised directly on Github.

The committee discussed allowing online sign-ups for new members of Quants and Quills. A web form would be established that would collect the name, address and email address of a potential member, along with the nominator and seconderâ€™s names. Simon moved that Quants and Quills would recognise this process as a valid method of accepting new members; Dan seconded; and the motion was carried. 

Rosie spoke about the list of email addresses she collected at the last meet-up. Simon said he would check in with Katie about whether she was still interested in starting a newsletter. Rosie said she would make the addresses available in a spreadsheet.

## 4. Future meetings

It was agreed the management committee would meet each three months in 2019. Rosie agreed to set these dates and email them to Simon and Dan.
