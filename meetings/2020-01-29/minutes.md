## 3. New business

Katie gave an update on the newsletter, saying she would soon send the first one of the year ahead of the first event.

The group discussed surveying people about the newsletter and decided to wrap this into a general survey for feedback about events.

There was then discussion of potential speakers for events in 2020. Dan suggested we take advantage of the International Communication Association conference in late May to get a big name for that month.

Simon will be absent for some months in the middle of the year so is focusing on documentation and other structural jobs, and hopes others can take on most responsibility for event organisation.

Sarah volunteers to coordinate the February event - suggests some speakers who can talk about US politics. Discussion of whether March event can focus on fires.

Discussion of whether to hold an event on the “nuts and bolts of data journalism” and charge participants for a “class”.

The meeting also discussed improving promotion of events - using Meetup.com, Facebook, Twitter, physical posters, Women In Media, alongside the newsletter.

## 4. Finances

We are slowly making our way through the cushion of funding that we had when Hub4101 was a sponsor. Thoughtworks have recommitted their sponsorship but we are looking at trying to get new sponsors too.

The group discusses approaching Google and Something Digital for sponsorship. Dan will drive this as treasurer.

The meeting was closed at 6:50pm.
