## 1. Previous minutes

A motion was passed to accept the minutes from the two previous meetings (September 2 and March 4)

## 2. New business

Discussion of plan for annual general meeting. Confirmed that this would be held over Zoom. Rosie to email members, asking them to RSVP for a Zoom link.

Discussion of October meetup. Daniel reports that QUT have agreed to a cobranded event to be hosted at a room at Gardens Point campus. Planning for October 28 and a theme around local media and the Queensland election. Katie to coordinate panel. Catering would be expensive because of COVID regulations but likely that Botanical Bar will be open.

Katie suggests doing a survey through Google forms to get some community opinions on local media, which could feed into the panel discussion. Dan mentions a QUT project that might also have data that could be useful for this.

Next meeting will be the annual general meeting on October 14.
